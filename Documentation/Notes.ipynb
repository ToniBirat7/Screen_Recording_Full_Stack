    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx create-next-app@latest\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we set up the project folder structure as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Folder Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **public**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `public` folder will contain the static files, such as images and fonts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **fonts**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fonts` folder will contain custom fonts. Inside the `fonts` folder, we've a typescript file `fonts.ts` that exports the custom fonts.\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "import localFont from \"next/font/local\";\n",
    "\n",
    "export const satoshi = localFont({\n",
    "  src: [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      path: \"./Satoshi-Light.woff2\",\n",
    "      weight: \"300\",\n",
    "      style: \"normal\",\n",
    "    },...\n",
    "  ],\n",
    "  variable: \"--font-satoshi\",\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code, loads the custom font files i.e. `Satoshi-Light.woff2`, `Satoshi-Regular.woff2`, etc from the local filesystem and generates a optimized `CSS` `@font-face` rule for each font file. The `variable` property allows us to use the font as a CSS variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@font-face` rules generated by the `next/font/local` package will be automatically injected into the global CSS of the application, making the fonts available for use throughout the app as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "@font-face {\n",
    "  font-family: \"__satoshi\";\n",
    "  src: url(\"/_next/static/media/Satoshi-Regular.woff2\") format(\"woff2\");\n",
    "  font-weight: 400;\n",
    "  font-style: normal;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@font-face` is a CSS rule that allows us to define custom fonts that can be loaded and used in the application. The `font-family` is set to a unique name (in this case, `__satoshi`), which can be used in the stylesheets to apply the font.\n",
    "\n",
    "As, the users won't have the `fonts` written in the CSS file, so we use the `next/font/local` package to load the fonts. This package optimizes the loading of the fonts by generating the necessary CSS rules and making them available globally in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, `CSS` variables are created for each font, allowing us to use them in our stylesheets like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".font_satoshi_variable_abc123 {\n",
    "  --font-satoshi: \"__satoshi\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, `fonts` are preloaded to avoid flashing and layout shifts when the fonts are loaded. This is done by adding the `preload` attribute to the `<link>` tag in the `_document.js` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/_next/static/media/Satoshi-Regular.woff2\" as=\"font\" type=\"font/woff2\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, `fonts` are hashed and served from `/_next/static/media/` to ensure that the browser caches them correctly and serves the correct version of the font files.\n",

    "Yes! At **build time**, Next.js:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Processes the font files (like `Satoshi-Regular.woff2`)\n",
    "- Optimizes them (e.g., hashes file names)\n",
    "- Generates `@font-face` rules\n",
    "- Outputs them into the final CSS\n",
    "- Generates `<link rel=\"preload\" ...>` tags\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"...when the user requests it, the HTML gets downloaded and `<link rel=\"preload\" ...>` runs and downloads the fonts...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! The **browser parses the HTML**, sees the `<link rel=\"preload\" ...>` tag, and starts downloading the font **early**—before it's even needed—**to reduce render delays**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<link\n",
    "  rel=\"preload\"\n",
    "  href=\"/_next/static/media/Satoshi-Regular.woff2\"\n",
    "  as=\"font\"\n",
    "  type=\"font/woff2\"\n",
    "  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n",
    "/>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures **fast and smooth rendering** (no flashing text).\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Then after download, the `@font-face` will have the link for the downloaded font and it will use it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "🟡 **Almost right**, with a small clarification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The browser sees your CSS, finds this:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  @font-face {\n",
    "    font-family: \"__satoshi\";\n",
    "    src: url(\"/_next/static/media/Satoshi-Regular.woff2\") format(\"woff2\");\n",

    "    font-style: normal;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now it knows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  > \"If something uses `font-family: __satoshi`, I should use this file at this weight/style.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, it finds elements styled like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  html.font_satoshi_variable_xyz {\n",
    "    --font-satoshi: \"__satoshi\";\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  body {\n",
    "    font-family: var(--font-satoshi), sans-serif;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- So the browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Sees that `--font-satoshi` equals `__satoshi`\n",
    "  2. Knows `@font-face` defines what `__satoshi` points to\n",
    "  3. Uses the preloaded font file that’s already been downloaded\n",
    "  4. Renders the text with `Satoshi`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timeline Recap:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build time**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Font files hashed and copied to `/_next/static/media/...`\n",
    "   - `@font-face` CSS is generated\n",
    "   - `link rel=\"preload\"` is added to the HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Client request**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - HTML is parsed\n",
    "   - Fonts are downloaded early via `<link rel=\"preload\">`\n",
    "   - CSS is parsed, `@font-face` tells how to use those fonts\n",
    "   - CSS variables like `--font-satoshi` are resolved\n",
    "   - Text renders instantly using the font\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the build, there will not be a single `CSS` file rather there will be multiple CSS files generated for each page and component.

Each page or component will have its own CSS file, which will be loaded only when that page or component is rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there will not be a single `HTML` file rather there will be multiple `HTML` files generated for each page. This is because Next.js uses **Dynamic Routing** to generate the HTML for each page based on the route. But depends on the rendering strategy used, the HTML files can be static or dynamic.\n",

    "### **app**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `app` folder will contain the main application code, including pages, components, and styles. Inside the `app` folder, we have the following structure:\n",

    "  --color-foreground: var(--foreground);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which sets up the theme variables for fonts and colors. Once the `browser` loads the `global.css`, it will have access to these variables and can use them in the stylesheets. All the `fonts` would have been downloaded and preloaded by the time the `global.css` is loaded, so the browser will not flash or shift the layout when the fonts are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**layout.tsx**\n",
    "\n",
    "`import { Karla } from \"next/font/google\";` loads the `Karla` font from Google Fonts during the build time.

    "# **React Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "This section contains notes related to React concepts, Next.js features, and best practices for building modern web applications. It serves as a quick reference guide for developers working with React and Next.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Short Circuiting**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `&&` and `||` operators to conditionally render components or values in React. This is known as short-circuit evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{\n",
    "  userImg && (\n",
    "    <Image\n",
    "      src={userImg || \"/assets/images/dummy.jpg\"}\n",
    "      alt=\"User\"\n",
    "      width={66}\n",
    "      height={66}\n",
    "      className=\"rounded-full\"\n",
    "    ></Image>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, if `userImg` is truthy, the `Image` component will be rendered. If `userImg` is falsy, nothing will be rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in the `src` attribute of the `Image` component, if `userImg` is falsy, it will default to `\"/assets/images/dummy.jpg\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using Map for Rendering Lists**\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we use an `array` inside a component, it will be rendered as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make use of the `map` function to iterate over the array and render each item as a component.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "isOpen && (\n",
    "          <ul className=\"dropdown\">\n",
    "            {[\"Most Recent\", \"Most Liked\"].map((option) => (\n",
    "              <li key={option} className=\"list-item\">\n",
    "                {option}\n",
    "              </li>\n",
    "            ))}\n",
    "          </ul>\n",
    "        )}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In, the above example, we are rendering a list of `options` inside a dropdown. The `map` function is used to iterate over the array of options and render each option as a list item. The `key` prop is used to uniquely identify each list item, which helps React optimize rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note,\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are not use `{}` to define expression for the `callback` function of the `map` method. This is because we are returning a single expression, which is the list item therefore we are using `()`. If we were to use `{}`, we would need to explicitly return the list item using the `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating Dummy Array**\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "{\n",
    "  Array.from({ length: 5 }).map((_, index) => (\n",
    "    <Image\n",
    "      src=\"/assets/icons/star.svg\"\n",
    "      alt=\"star\"\n",
    "      width={20}\n",
    "      height={20}\n",
    "      key={index}\n",
    "    ></Image>\n",
    "  ));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we are creating a dummy array of length 5 using `Array.from({ length: 5 })`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an array `[undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]` which we can then map over to render our `Image` components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `_` is a convention used to indicate that the value is not going to be used. In this case, we are not using the first argument of the `map` function, which represents the current element of the array. Instead, we are only interested in the `index` argument, which represents the current index of the element being processed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Hooks**\n",
    "\n",
    "In `React`, `Hooks` are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They allow you to manage state, side effects, context, and more in functional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some commonly used hooks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **useState**: Allows you to add state to your functional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **useEffect**: Lets you perform side effects in your components, such as data fetching or subscriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **useContext**: Provides a way to access context values in your components.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`useRef` Hook**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `useRef` hook is used to create a mutable reference that persists for the full lifetime of the component. It can be used to access and interact with DOM elements directly, as well as to store any mutable value that you want to keep around without causing re-renders.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hook gives programmatic access to the `DOM` node via `inputRef.current`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import React, { useRef } from \"react\";\n",
    "\n",
    "const MyComponent = () => {\n",
    "  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n",
    "\n",
    "  const focusInput = () => {\n",
    "    inputRef.current.focus();\n",
    "  };\n",
    "\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <input ref={inputRef} type=\"text\" />\n",
    "      <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we create a ref using `useRef` and attach it to the input element. When the button is clicked, we can call `focus()` on the input element using the ref.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **window.URL in JavaScript**\n",
    "\n",
    "By default when `JavaScript` is running in the `Browser` we do not need to explicitly use `window.` to access global objects like `URL`. This is because the browser automatically provides these global objects in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "`URL` is a global interface `(window.URL)` with two roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **URL Parser/Constructor**: It can parse and construct URLs, providing methods to manipulate URL components. `new URL('url')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Blob URL Creator**: It can create object URLs for `Blob` and `File` objects, allowing for efficient file handling in web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "`URL.createObjectURL(blob)` creates a temporary `Blob` URL string such as `blob:https://yourapp.com/23423-adsf-23423`. This is a temporary URL that points to bytes of the given `Blob` or `File` managed by the browser, no external network requests are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "`createObjectURL` gives fast preview without `Base64` conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "`URL.revokeObjectURL(url)` is used to release an object URL created by `URL.createObjectURL()`. This is important for preventing memory leaks, as the browser keeps a reference to the object URL until it is explicitly revoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `blob` is a file-like object of immutable, raw data. Blobs represent data that isn't necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. They can be used to hold data that you want to upload or download, and they can be created from various sources, such as files, strings, or other binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`blob` lives until we call `revokeObjectURL` or the document is unloaded. Therefore, it's important to manage the lifecycle of blobs properly to avoid memory leaks.\n",

    "## **Custom Hooks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow you to extract and reuse stateful logic across multiple components. They enable you to encapsulate complex logic and share it easily without changing the component hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating a Custom Hook**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom hook, you simply define a function that uses one or more of the built-in React hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) and returns the desired state or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's create a custom hook called `useCounter` that manages a counter value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "import { useState } from \"react\";\n",
    "\n",
    "const useCounter = (initialValue = 0) => {\n",
    "  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);\n",
    "\n",
    "  const increment = () => setCount((prev) => prev + 1);\n",
    "  const decrement = () => setCount((prev) => prev - 1);\n",
    "  const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);\n",
    "\n",
    "  return { count, increment, decrement, reset };\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "export default useCounter;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using a Custom Hook**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use your custom hook in any functional component just like you would use a built-in hook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "import { ChangeEvent, useRef, useState } from \"react\";\n",
    "\n",
    "export const useFileInput = (maxSize: number) => {\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Reusability**: Custom hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components without duplicating code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Separation of Concerns**: By extracting logic into custom hooks, you can keep your components clean and focused on rendering UI.\n",

    "The problem with the above approach is that whenever the `FormField` will render the `InputToRender` won't be able to keep the context due which problems such as losing focus in the input fields can be seen. This leads to a poor user experience as the user has to click back into the input field every time they make a change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Actual Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem arises because of how the `Reconciliation` algorithm works in `React`. For each component re-render `React` will first create a `Virtual DOM` then compare it with the previous one state of the `Virtual DOM` to determine what has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Reconciliation` algorithm will check for the `type` of the component and its `key`. If the `type` and `key` are the same, React will reuse the existing component instance. If not, it will create a new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if the `type` of the component changes, React will unmount the previous instance and mount a new one. This means that any local state (such as focus) will be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Below is the Better Explanation for Type Checking in Reconciliation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**First: What is Reconciliation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reconciliation = the algorithm React uses to decide how to update the **real DOM** based on changes in the **virtual DOM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On each render, React builds a new **virtual DOM tree**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It then compares this new tree with the previous one (diffing).\n",
    "\n",
    "- React updates only the parts of the **real DOM** that changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules React Reconciliation Algo Follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Same type** → reuse the existing DOM node/component and update its props/children.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: `<div>` → `<div>` ✅ same type, so React just updates attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Different type** → throw away the old subtree and mount a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: `<div>` → `<span>` ❌ different type, React discards the whole old `<div>` subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lists of children** → React uses `key` to match old and new children. Without stable keys, it may unnecessarily throw away nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Reconciliation` is **recursive**, not just top-level.\n",
    "\n",

    "# **Next.js Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some notes related to Next.js concepts, features, and best practices for building modern web applications with Next.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Importing**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we've to import a constant or utility from a file in the root directory, we can use the `@` alias to refer to the root directory. This allows us to avoid using relative paths like `../../constants`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to import the `ICONS` object from the `constants` file, we can do it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import { ICONS } from \"@/constants\";` imports the `ICONS` object from the `constants` file located in the root directory of the project. The `@` symbol is an alias for the root directory, which allows us to import files without using relative paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Revalidate Path in NextJs**\n",
    "\n",
    "`revalidatePath` is a **Next.js function** from `next/cache` that allows you to **manually trigger cache invalidation and regeneration** of a specific route (path).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as:\n",
    "👉 \"Hey Next.js, the data for this page might be outdated. Please re-fetch and re-render the page (or its data cache) the next time it’s requested.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Next.js (App Router):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pages and layouts are often cached** (either statically generated at build time or on-demand using ISR, or cached with fetch + revalidate).\n",
    "- When data **changes** (e.g., you upload a new video to your DB), the cached version of `/` may still show the **old state**.\n",
    "- `revalidatePath(\"/\")` tells Next.js: _“Invalidate the cache for `/` so users see the updated data next time they load it.”_\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does it work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You perform some mutation (upload video → save to Xata DB).\n",
    "2. After the DB update, you call:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```ts\n",
    "   import { revalidatePath } from \"next/cache\";\n",
    "\n",
    "   revalidatePath(\"/\");\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next.js marks `/` as **stale** in its cache.\n",
    "4. On the next request to `/`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If the route was **static (ISR)** → Next.js rebuilds it on demand with fresh data.\n",
    "   - If the route uses **fetch with `{ cache: \"force-cache\" }` or `revalidate: x`** → Next.js re-fetches fresh data.\n",
    "   - If it was **dynamic** → it simply runs again with updated server-side logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Screen Recording Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose your homepage `/` lists uploaded videos.\n",
    "Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User uploads a recording → stored in **Xata DB**.\n",
    "2. You want the homepage `/` to show the new video in the list.\n",
    "3. Without `revalidatePath(\"/\")`, the homepage might keep showing cached old data (missing the new video).\n",
    "4. With `revalidatePath(\"/\")`, Next.js knows to **refresh homepage cache** → now users see the updated video list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Mental Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Without revalidatePath**\n",
    "  `/` → 🗃️ Cached snapshot (old video list) → Users don’t see updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **With revalidatePath(\"/\")**\n",
    "  `/` → ⚡ Cache invalidated → Next request pulls fresh data from DB → Users see updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Related functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `revalidateTag(tag)` → Invalidate all routes/data fetches marked with a certain tag (better for fine-grained invalidation).\n",
    "- `unstable_noStore()` → Disable caching for certain fetches (always dynamic).\n",
    "- `revalidatePath(path, \"layout\" | \"page\")` → Optionally target only a `layout` or `page`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**In short:**\n",
    "`revalidatePath(\"/\")` in your project ensures the homepage **immediately reflects new video uploads** from the Xata DB, instead of waiting for cache expiry or ISR timeouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`NextRequest` in Next.js**\n",
    "\n",
    "`NextRequest` inherits from the native `Request` interface, adding some Next.js specific features and utilities. It is used to represent incoming requests in Next.js API routes and middleware.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, every request passed from `middleware.ts` to the API route handler is an instance of `NextRequest`. This means you can use all the features of `NextRequest` in your API routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "import { NextRequest } from \"next/server\";\n",
    "\n",
    "export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n",
    "  const json = await req.json();\n",
    "  console.log(json);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `NextRequest` is used to handle a POST request, automatically parsing the JSON body.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we're using `req.json()` to parse the JSON body of the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we call the `req.json()` method, on the instance of `NextRequest` it is consumed. Because the body of the `NextRequest` is a `stream`, it can only be read once. If you need to access the body multiple times, you'll have to cache or store it in an intermediate variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case if we want an instance of `NextRequest` with the same body multiple times, we can create a new `NextRequest` instance using the original request's properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "const rawBody = await req.json();\n",
    "const newReq = new Request(req.url, {\n",
    "  method: req.method,\n",
    "  headers: req.headers,\n",
    "  body: JSON.stringify(rawBody),\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "OR,\n",
    "\n",
    "We can `clone` if we need the original request intact for multiple consumers:\n",
    "\n",

    "## **Understand NextJs Layout and Page (NextJs in Deployment)**\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Next.js uses a file-based routing system, where each file in the `app` directory corresponds to a route in the application. The `layout.tsx` file is used to define the layout for the entire application, while the `page.tsx` file is used to define the content for the home page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧵 Real-World Deployment & Routing Behavior in Next.js – Am I Thinking Right?\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve been diving deep into how Next.js works under the hood, especially with the App Router and how layout/page rendering and navigation happen — but I just want to make sure I’ve got it right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we have a route like `/home`, and inside that we have nested routes like `/home/admin`, `/home/login`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "From what I understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `layout.tsx` inside `app/home/` acts as the shared layout for all its child routes.\n",
    "- When a user first visits `/home`, the full HTML (including the layout) is rendered on the server and sent to the browser.\n",
    "- Now if they navigate to `/home/login`, since the layout hasn’t changed, Next.js won’t re-render the whole page — just the part that’s different (`page.tsx` inside `/home/login/`), right?\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m also trying to understand what exactly happens on the network during that route change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it like this?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of requesting a whole new HTML file like a traditional multi-page app, the client sends a request to the Next.js server (some API or internal endpoint?).\n",
    "- That server returns some data (maybe not raw HTML, but something like a component tree or serialized JSX?).\n",
    "- Then the client JS takes that, figures out what’s new, and updates the DOM inside the already-mounted layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is that how it works in the real world?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, when we build the project (`next build`), does it generate separate HTML/CSS/JS chunks per route or component so that only what’s needed is loaded during navigation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I'm used to working with Express where you do something like `http.createServer(...)` — but how does that server part work in Next.js deployments? Is it managed for us (like on Vercel), or do we manually handle server setup?\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent explanation attempt! You're very close and clearly thinking deeply about **how Next.js works under the hood**, especially with the **App Router**, **server components**, **routing**, and **deployment model**.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Each `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` is compiled into a **React Server Component** (RSC).\n",
    "- Next.js uses **Webpack** and **Turbopack** to bundle code per route — only the JS/CSS needed for `/home/login` is included in that route's chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Server code and client code are separated**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Server components (`layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`) don’t ship to the browser.\n",
    "- Only **client components** (with `'use client'`) are bundled for the browser.\n",

    "4. **HTML pre-rendering (if using SSG) or bundling for SSR**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you use `generateStaticParams` and `export const dynamic = 'force-static'`, Next.js may pre-render `.html` and `.json` files for those routes.\n",
    "- Otherwise, for SSR (default), the HTML will be generated dynamically at runtime.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📍 User visits `/home` (first time)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Client makes request to `/home`**\n",

    "   - CSS classes, `@font-face`, and metadata are injected.\n",
    "   - This full HTML is streamed back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Browser receives and paints HTML**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The HTML already contains `div#__next` with all components rendered.\n",
    "   - Fonts are preloaded.\n",
    "   - JS bundles are preloaded and begin hydrating.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hydration happens**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Next.js uses React to attach event listeners and state to already-rendered HTML.\n",

    "1. **The client-side router (`next/navigation`) intercepts the route change.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This is like how React Router works — single-page navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Next.js fetches a JSON payload from the server**\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Client-side React receives this JSON and renders it**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - React uses this data to rebuild the new component tree (`home/login/page.tsx`).\n",
    "   - Any layouts that haven’t changed (`home/layout.tsx`, `root layout.tsx`) are **reused**.\n",
    "   - Only the new part (`home/login/page.tsx`) is rendered and hydrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The new DOM gets mounted without full page reload**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Browser doesn't refresh.\n",
    "   - Layout doesn't re-render if it hasn't changed.\n",
    "   - Only the new route content is added inside the layout.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **TL;DR**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when NextJs builds your app, it optimizes everything — from fonts to layouts to routes. It preloads fonts, generates CSS variables, and ensures that your app is fast and efficient. When users navigate, it uses client-side routing to update only the necessary parts of the page without reloading the entire layout, making the experience smooth and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "It divides the components based on routes and based on server or client components, it optimizes the loading of styles and scripts. The deployment is managed by Next.js, which handles the server setup and routing for you, allowing you to focus on building your application without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it does not load the entire HTML file for each route change, but rather fetches the necessary data and updates the DOM accordingly, making it a highly efficient framework for building modern web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "It calls the API to fetch the required component as `JSON`, which is then used to update the existing layout without a full page reload.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows for a **fast, responsive user experience** while maintaining the benefits of server-side rendering and static site generation.\n"

    "## 1. **Intern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "So Next.js does not run on Node.js runtime? The creators changed Node.js and made their own runtime called Edge Runtime where every Next.js runs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Senior Dev:**\n",
    "Not exactly.\n",
    "By default, a Next.js application **runs on the Node.js runtime**, the same environment used by most backend JavaScript code.\n",
    "The **Edge runtime** is an **additional runtime option**, not a replacement for Node.js.\n",
    "It’s built on V8 isolates (like Chrome’s JavaScript engine) and works more like Cloudflare Workers or Deno Deploy, not like Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Intern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so what’s the difference between Node runtime and Edge runtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Senior Dev:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Node.js Runtime**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional JavaScript runtime for backend servers\n",
    "- Gives full access to Node APIs like `fs`, `net`, and `crypto`\n",
    "- Can connect to databases directly over TCP (e.g., using `node-postgres` or `mysql2`)\n",
    "- Runs in one or a few centralized locations\n",
    "- Cold starts can be slower in serverless environments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge Runtime**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lightweight JavaScript runtime running at CDN/edge locations close to the user\n",
    "- Supports only Web Standard APIs (`fetch`, `Request`, `Response`, `crypto.subtle`)\n",
    "- No Node.js APIs, no TCP sockets\n",
    "- Very fast startup times and globally distributed execution\n",
    "- Ideal for quick tasks like authentication, caching, A/B testing, personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Intern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "So in Next.js, everything runs on Edge runtime by default?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Senior Dev:**\n",
    "No. In a brand-new Next.js app without any special configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pages, API routes, and server components** → Node.js runtime\n",
    "- **Middleware** → Edge runtime (this is the only part that defaults to Edge)\n",

    "So if I create a Next.js app, will it run some parts on Node runtime and some on Edge runtime automatically?\n",

    "**Senior Dev:**\n",
    "Not automatically. By default:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everything is Node.js runtime except Middleware.\n",

    "export const runtime = \"edge\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 5. **Intern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then why would a project choose Edge runtime instead of Node runtime?\n",

    "**Senior Dev:**\n",
    "Projects choose Edge runtime when they need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global distribution** (run code close to users around the world)\n",
    "- **Low-latency responses**\n",
    "- **Very fast cold starts**\n",
    "- To handle lightweight logic that doesn’t need full Node APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off is that some libraries, like `node-postgres`, won’t work because Edge runtime doesn’t support raw TCP connections. In such cases, developers use databases that work over HTTP APIs (like Xata, Supabase REST, FaunaDB).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Intern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "So that’s why our project used Xata with Drizzle ORM instead of node-postgres?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Senior Dev:**\n",
    "Exactly. Since `node-postgres` needs TCP sockets, it won’t run in Edge runtime. Xata works over HTTP, so it’s compatible with Edge runtime.\n",
    "If the team wanted to stick to Node runtime, they could have used `node-postgres` — but they probably wanted the performance benefits of Edge for some parts of the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **Intern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, Node runtime is for full-featured backend code, and Edge runtime is for fast, distributed, lightweight code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Senior Dev:**\n",
    "That’s the right way to think about it. They’re not replacements for each other — they’re tools for different use cases. In a single Next.js app, you can mix both depending on your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node.js runtime** → Full Node API access, TCP connections, heavier server logic, runs in centralized locations.\n",
    "- **Edge runtime** → Web API only, no TCP, runs globally with low latency, perfect for small tasks close to the user.\n",
    "- In Next.js, **Node.js is default** except for Middleware (always Edge). You can opt into Edge manually for other routes.\n",

    "## **Routing in Next.js**\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next.js uses a file-based routing system, where each file in the `app` directory corresponds to a route in the application. The routing is dynamic and can be nested, allowing for complex applications with multiple levels of navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Routing**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Next.js, the routing is based on the file structure in the `app` directory. Each file represents a route, and the folder structure defines the hierarchy of routes. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "app/\n",
    "├── about/\n",
    "│   └── page.tsx             ← Renders /about\n",
    "├── blog/\n",
    "│   ├── [slug]/\n",
    "│   │   └── page.tsx         ← Renders /blog/[slug]\n",
    "│   └── page.tsx             ← Renders /blog\n",
    "├── contact/\n",
    "│   └── page.tsx             ← Renders /contact\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dynamic Routing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic routing allows you to create routes that can change based on the data or parameters passed to them. In Next.js, you can create dynamic routes by using square brackets in the file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to create a route for blog posts that can change based on the post slug, you can create a file named `[slug].tsx` inside the `blog` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "app/\n",
    "├── blog/\n",
    "│   ├── [slug]/\n",
    "│   │   └── page.tsx         ← Renders /blog/[slug]\n",
    "│   └── page.tsx             ← Renders /blog\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Nested Routing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested routing allows you to create routes that are organized in a hierarchy. In Next.js, you can create nested routes by creating folders inside the `app` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to create a route for a blog post that has comments, you can create a folder named `comments` inside the `[slug]` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```app/\n",
    "├── blog/\n",

    "Catch-all routes allow you to create a route that can match multiple segments of the URL. In Next.js, you can create a catch-all route by using three dots (`...`) in the file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to create a route that can match any URL under the `blog` directory, you can create a file named `[...slug].tsx` inside the `blog` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "app/\n",
    "├── blog/\n",
    "│   ├── [...slug]/\n",
    "│   │   └── page.tsx         ← Renders /blog/[...slug]\n",
    "│   └── page.tsx             ← Renders /blog\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Route Groups**\n",
    "\n",
    "Route groups allow you to organize routes into logical groups without affecting the URL structure. You can create route groups by wrapping folder names in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can group authentication-related routes together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "app/\n",
    "├── (auth)/\n",
    "│   ├── login/\n",
    "│   │   └── page.tsx         ← Renders /login\n",
    "│   ├── register/\n",
    "│   │   └── page.tsx         ← Renders /register\n",
    "│   ├── forgot-password/\n",
    "│   │   └── page.tsx         ← Renders /forgot-password\n",
    "│   └── layout.tsx           ← Shared layout for auth pages\n",
    "├── (dashboard)/\n",
    "│   ├── analytics/\n",
    "│   │   └── page.tsx         ← Renders /analytics\n",

    "│   └── layout.tsx           ← Shared layout for dashboard pages\n",
    "└── page.tsx                 ← Renders /\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `(auth)` and `(dashboard)` folders are route groups that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Don't affect the URL structure** - `/login` not `/(auth)/login`\n",
    "- **Allow shared layouts** - Each group can have its own `layout.tsx`\n",
    "- **Help organize code** - Logically group related routes together\n",
    "- **Enable different styling** - Apply different themes per group\n",
    "\n",
    "Route groups are particularly useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Authentication flows** - Group login, register, reset password pages\n",
    "- **Admin sections** - Separate admin routes with different layouts\n",
    "- **Multi-tenant apps** - Different layouts for different user types\n",
    "- **A/B testing** - Group routes for different experimental layouts\n"

    "## **Understanding Hydration in Next.js**\n",
    "\n",
    "Things we need to have understand before we understand hydration in Next.js:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: The process of rendering a web page on the server and sending the fully rendered HTML to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: The process of rendering a web page in the browser using JavaScript after the initial HTML has been loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now,\n",
    "\n",
    "**What was the problem before hydration?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before hydration, the problem was that when a page was rendered on the server and sent to the client, it was static HTML. This meant that the page could not be interactive until the JavaScript was loaded and executed in the browser. Users would see a fully rendered page, but any dynamic behavior (like clicking buttons, submitting forms, etc.) would not work until the JavaScript was fully loaded and executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the page would appear static and unresponsive until the JavaScript was ready, leading to a poor user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, Next.js introduced `hydration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hydration**\n",
    "\n",
    "We knew what was the problem before hydration, now let's understand what hydration is.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Hydration` is the process of taking the static HTML that was rendered on the `server` and `\"activating\"` it in the browser by attaching `event listeners` and `state` to it. This allows the page to become `interactive` without needing to `reload` or re-render the entire page.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user visits a page, Next.js sends the fully rendered HTML to the `client`. Once the `JavaScript` is loaded, Next.js \"hydrates\" this HTML by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attaching Event Listeners**: It adds event listeners to the elements in the HTML so that they can respond to user interactions (like clicks, form submissions, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Restoring Component State**: It restores the state of the components (like form inputs, toggles, etc.) to match what was rendered on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Making the Page Interactive**: After hydration, the page becomes fully interactive, allowing users to interact with it as they would with a client-rendered page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Does Hydration Work in Next.js?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user visits a page in a Next.js application, the following steps occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Server Renders the Page**: The server renders the page and sends the fully rendered HTML to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Client Receives the HTML**: The browser receives the HTML and displays it to the user. At this point, the page is static and unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **JavaScript Loads**: The JavaScript bundle for the page is loaded in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hydration Begins**: Next.js starts the hydration process by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Parsing the HTML to find React components.\n",
    "   - Attaching event listeners to the elements in the HTML.\n",
    "   - Restoring the state of the components.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Page Becomes Interactive**: Once hydration is complete, the page becomes fully interactive, and users can interact with it as they would with a client-rendered page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Hydration**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Performance**: By rendering the initial HTML on the server, users see a fully rendered page faster, improving the perceived performance of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SEO Friendly**: Since the initial HTML is fully rendered, search engines can crawl and index the content more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Better User Experience**: Users can see the content immediately, and once hydration is complete, they can interact with the page without any noticeable delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Challenges with Hydration**\n",
    "\n",
    "While hydration provides many benefits, it also comes with some challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Content Mismatch**: If the content rendered on the server does not match what the client expects, it can lead to warnings like \"Text content did not match.\" This can happen if there are differences in how the server and client render components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance Overhead**: Hydration can add some overhead, especially for large pages with many components. The process of attaching event listeners and restoring state can take time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **JavaScript Dependency**: The page relies on JavaScript to become interactive, so if the JavaScript fails to load or execute, the page will remain static.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices for Hydration in Next.js**\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure smooth hydration in Next.js applications, consider the following best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistent Rendering**: Ensure that the server and client render the same content. Avoid using browser-specific APIs or state that can lead to mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimize Component Size**: Keep components small and focused to reduce the overhead during hydration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Minimize State**: Keep the component state to a minimum and avoid complex state management during hydration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use `useEffect` Wisely**: Use the `useEffect` hook to handle client-specific logic that should not run during server rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Monitor Performance**: Use tools like Lighthouse to monitor the performance of your application and identify any hydration-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydration is a crucial process in Next.js that transforms static HTML into an interactive web page. By rendering the initial content on the server and then hydrating it in the browser, Next.js provides a fast, SEO-friendly, and user-friendly experience. Understanding how hydration works and following best practices can help developers build efficient and responsive applications.\n"
