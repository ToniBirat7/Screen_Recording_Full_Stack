    "## **Working of `Blob` and `URL` in the Browser**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before, moving forward we need userstand what actually a `Blob` is and how it works in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blob**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Blob` is a file-like immutable object (we cannot change it's bytes) representing binary data in the browser. The created `Blob` maybe stored in memory or on disk as temporary file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`const blob = new Blob(chunks, { type: \"video/webm\" });` : This line creates a new `Blob` object from an array of data chunks, specifying the MIME type as \"video/webm\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The `blob` object stores references to the binary data chunks, allowing it to be treated like a file. This `blob` is made accessible via JS APIs like (`slice()`, `stream()`, `text()`, `arrayBuffer()`) and can be used in various contexts, such as uploading to a server or creating object URLs for media playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small `blob` objects are typically stored in memory (RAM) for quick access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large `blob` objects may be stored as `OS Temp Files` on disk to avoid excessive memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose there's a `blob` object created from recorded video data. And we know that `blob` objects are not directly usable in HTML elements like `<video>` or `<img>`. To use a `blob` in such elements, we need to create a temporary URL that points to the `blob` data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements require a URL to fetch and display the media content. This is where `URL` comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **URL**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `URL` interface in JavaScript provides methods to create and manage URLs. One of its key methods is `URL.createObjectURL()`, which generates a temporary URL that points to a `blob` or `File` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know that `blob` objects are not directly usable in HTML elements like `<video>` or `<img>`. To use a `blob` in such elements, we need to create a temporary URL that points to the `blob` data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that we need to provide a `URL` to the `src` attribute of these elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "As any `blob` will be stored in browsers memory or as a temporary file on disk, we need it's reference to access it. This is where `URL.createObjectURL()` comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `URL.createObjectURL(blob)` to create a temporary URL that points to the `blob` data. This URL can then be assigned to the `src` attribute of HTML elements like `<video>` or `<img>`, allowing them to fetch and display the media content.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once, we've the `URL` for the `blob`, we can use it in our HTML elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```tsx\n",
    "const videoUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n",
    "<video src={videoUrl} controls />;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as the `Browser` sees the `videoUrl` i.e. something like `blob:http://localhost:3000/abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop`, it runs it's media loading pipeline to fetch the data from the `blob` URL and play it in the `<video>` element.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, first the browser recognizes that the URL is a `blob` URL, it resolves the `URL` to make internal request to fetch the `blob` data from memory or disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the loader gets a `handler` to the `blob` data, the `handler` offers methods to read the `blob` data in streams of bytes with the help of `slice()`, `stream()`, `text()`, `arrayBuffer()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, only few `KB` to fetch the `header` of the `blob` data to understand the file format, codecs, duration etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the `header` the demuxer determines the codec `(Opus for audio, VP8/VP9 for video)` and then the browser requests more data in chunks to decode and play the media.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the user `seeks` to a different time in the video, the media pipeline may request specific byte ranges from the `Blob` to find the nearest keyframe for smooth playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the browser decodes the binary data and renders it in the `<video>` element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we use `URL.createObjectURL()`, no copy of the `blob` data is made. Instead, the browser creates a reference to the existing `blob` data, which is efficient in terms of memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No external network request is made when using the `blob` URL. The browser retrieves the data directly from memory or disk, ensuring fast access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `blob` URL is temporary and valid only within the context of the current document. It will be revoked automatically when the document is unloaded or when we explicitly call `URL.revokeObjectURL()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's important to call `URL.revokeObjectURL()` when the `blob` URL is no longer needed to free up memory resources.\n"

    "## **Understand `useEffect` hook in React**\n",
    "\n",
    "`useEffect` is a hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in functional components after rendering. Side effects can include tasks like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means, `useEffect` `callback` runs only after the component i.e. `DOM` has been rendered for the first time. This is important because it ensures that any side effects are performed after the initial render, preventing potential issues with accessing DOM elements that may not yet exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if we've passed `dependency array` to the `useEffect`, the `callback` will run again whenever any of the dependencies change. This allows us to control when the effect should re-run based on specific state or prop changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use `return` inside `useEffect`, it serves as a `cleanup function` that runs when the component unmounts or before the effect runs again. This is useful for cleaning up resources like event listeners or timers to prevent memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot pass `async` as a `callback` function directly to `useEffect` because `useEffect` expects a synchronous function that either returns nothing or a cleanup function. An `async` function returns a promise, which is not compatible with the expected return type of `useEffect`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we need to perform asynchronous operations inside `useEffect`, we can define an inner `async` function and call it within the `useEffect` callback. This way, we can still use `async/await` syntax while adhering to the synchronous nature of the `useEffect` callback.\n"
