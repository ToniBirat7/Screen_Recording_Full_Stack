    "\n",
    "After looking at the design, we identify the components needed, bases pages that we need, number of routes that we need to create. This way are able to divide the UI into smaller components and pages, much needed for reusability and maintainability.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Then header and footer will be used in all pages, but the content will change based on the page.\n",

    "Altogether we will have 2 layouts i.e. for the `auth` and `main` pages because the NavBar is not needed in the `auth` pages.\n",

    "We will use the `(root)` routing provided by Next.js, which allows us to create a folder structure that maps directly to the URL structure of our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `(root)` folder will contain the main layout and the NavBar component, which will be used across all pages.\n",
    "\n",

    "By default, the `layout.tsx` top level component will be the parent of all the pages in the `app` directory, and it will be used to define the layout for all pages in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, based on the change in route, the `layout.tsx` file will be used to render the appropriate layout for the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the `auth` route, we will use the URL `/auth`, which will render the `layout.tsx` file in the `(auth)` folder.\n",

    "Will have logo, then user profile icon.\n",

    "The user data will be fetched from the server using the `getServerSession` function from the `next-auth` package.\n",

    "The `getServerSession` function will be used to get the user session data from the server, which will be used to determine if the user is logged in or not.\n",
