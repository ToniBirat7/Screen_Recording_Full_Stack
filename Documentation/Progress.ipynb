    "\n",
    "We will use `Drizzle ORM` to connect with the `Xata` database.\n",

    "[Link](https://orm.drizzle.team/)\n",
    "\n",
    "[SetUp_Drizzle_With_Xata](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started) : Click get started with `Xata` and follow the steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **What is ORM?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`ORM` stands for `Object-Relational Mapping`. It is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. In simpler terms, it allows developers to interact with a database using the programming language's native objects, rather than writing raw SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Drizzle ORM**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an `ORM` for `TypeScript` that provides a simple and intuitive API for working with databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is `ORM` specifically for `serverless` databases i.e. `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `SQLite`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Installation of Drizzle ORM**\n",
    "\n",
    "To install `Drizzle ORM`, you can use `npm` or `yarn`. Run one of the following commands in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install drizzle-orm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll need to install `Drizzle Kit` that will create the `SQL` migrations. It is a command line tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install -D drizzle-kit // For Development\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will need `Postgres` package to talk to the `PostgreSQL` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install pg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll create `db.ts` file inside `drizzle/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file, we will write the Config to connect `Drizzle` and `Xata`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "import { drizzle } from \"drizzle-orm/node-postgres\";\n",
    "import { Pool } from \"pg\"; // For PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "const pool = new Pool({\n",
    "  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "export const db = drizzle(pool);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we are importing the `Pool` class from the `pg` module and creating a new instance of it with the connection string from the environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then pass the connection pool to the `drizzle` function to create a database connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will create `Schema` for our database. The `schema.ts` file is also created inside `drizzle/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll add the `Authentication` schema that will be auto generated by `BetterAuth`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, will need to create `drizzle` config file `drizzle.config.ts` inside the root folder.\n",

    "```bash\n",

    "Then,\n",

    "  },\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `drizzle.config.ts` file, we will export the configuration using `defineConfig` from `drizzle-kit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `export` will be an `object` that contains all the necessary configuration options for `Drizzle ORM` to connect to the `PostgreSQL` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally,\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll have to setup `BetterAuth`, Create a folder named `lib` in the root directory. Inside, this folder create a file named `auth.ts`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will connect `Drizzle`,`BetterAuth` and the Database i.e. `Xata`.\n",
