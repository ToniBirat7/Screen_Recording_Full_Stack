    "### **What is ORM?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`ORM` stands for `Object-Relational Mapping`. It is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. In simpler terms, it allows developers to interact with a database using the programming language's native objects, rather than writing raw SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Drizzle ORM**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an `ORM` for `TypeScript` that provides a simple and intuitive API for working with databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is `ORM` specifically for `serverless` databases i.e. `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `SQLite`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Installation of Drizzle ORM**\n",
    "\n",
    "To install `Drizzle ORM`, you can use `npm` or `yarn`. Run one of the following commands in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install drizzle-orm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll need to install `Drizzle Kit` that will create the `SQL` migrations. It is a command line tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install -D drizzle-kit // For Development\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will need `Postgres` package to talk to the `PostgreSQL` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install pg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll create `db.ts` file inside `drizzle/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file, we will write the Config to connect `Drizzle` and `Xata`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "import { drizzle } from \"drizzle-orm/xata-http\";\n",
    "import { getXataClient } from \"../xata\";\n",
    "\n",
    "export const db = drizzle(getXataClient()); // Export the DB connection\n",

    "Finally,\n",

    "- Used by **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used by **Better Auth** to understand your table structure\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You write** schema.ts with your desired table structure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **You run** `npx drizzle-kit push` to create/update tables in Xata\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **You run** `xata pull main` to sync the client with actual database\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Your app uses both:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `schema.ts` for `ORM operations` and `Better Auth`\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `xata.ts` for `HTTP` communication with `Xata`\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What Happens If You Delete schema.ts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Bad Effects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Better Auth breaks** - it needs your schema to know table structure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No type safety** in your Drizzle queries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Can't make schema changes** - no way to define new tables/columns\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No migrations** - can't evolve your database structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What Happens If You Delete xata.ts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Bad Effects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Xata HTTP client breaks** - can't communicate with database\n",

    "- **xata.ts** = The actual building that exists 🏗️\n",
    "\n",
    "You need the blueprint to make changes, and you need to know what the actual building looks like to use it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Best Practice - Keep Both and Understand Their Roles:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modify schema.ts** when you want to change your database structure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run `npx drizzle-kit push`** to apply changes to Xata\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run `xata pull main`** to sync the client\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`Bunny` is a video hosting and streaming platform that allows users to upload, store, and share videos. It provides a simple API for developers to integrate video functionality into their applications, making it easy to manage video content.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a `CDN` i.e. Content Delivery Network, which means it distributes video content across multiple servers worldwide to ensure fast and reliable delivery to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "It let's us `host`, `stream`, and `deliver` video content with low latency and high performance. `Bunny` also provides features like adaptive bitrate streaming, video analytics, and secure token authentication to enhance the video delivery experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Bunny Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `Bunny` free for 14 days. Login to [Bunny](https://bunny.net/) and create an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "First click on `Storage` then create a `Storage-Zone`. Choose `Geo Replication Zone`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, create a folder `thumbnail`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to `FTP & API Access` copy the `password` and paste in the `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, copy the `hostname` and paste in the `constants/index.ts` `STORAGE_BASE_URL='https://hostname/username'`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Now,\n",
    "\n",
    "After we've stored our `Files` we need to create something called `Pull Zones`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pull Zones` will be used to get our `Thumbnail` URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a Pull Zone, go to `CDN` then `Create Pull Zones` tab in your Bunny dashboard and click on `Add Pull Zone`. Give your Pull Zone a name i.e. `snapcat-pull-z` and select the `Storage Zone` you created earlier i.e. `snapcast-videos`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your Pull Zone is created, you will be given a `Pull Zone URL`. This URL is what you will use to access your video content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then copy the `Hostname` and paste it in the `constants/index.ts` file as `CDN_URL='https://snapcast-pull-z.b-cdn.net'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "After we store the videos, we will also need to stream those videos. For that we need to create got to `Stream` then create `Video Library` i.e. `stream-snapcast`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then click on `API`, copy the `Video Library ID` and paste it the `.env`. Similarly copy the `API Key` and paste it in the `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, copy the `CDN Hostname` and paste in the `constants/index.ts` file as `TRANSCRIPT_URL: \"https://vz-e62b6266-4f0.b-cdn.net\"`. This will be used for transcription. It is optional we can `enable` it by clicking on `Transcribing`.\n",

    "**1. Frontend (React/Next.js page)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The button triggers a **POST request** to the backend endpoint `/api/auth/sign-in/social`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The request may include information such as the OAuth provider (Google) and optionally the user's email.\n",
    "\n",

    "```ts\n",
    "fetch(\"/api/auth/sign-in/social\", {\n",

    "  1. `shield` → Blocks suspicious/malicious activity.\n",
    "\n",

    "  3. User logs in with Google → Google returns an OAuth code/token to your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Better Auth exchanges the code for user info.\n",

A native `<video>` gives more control but requires you to handle streaming formats, compatibility (HLS support), DRM, analytics, and player UI (or include a player library).\n",

    "## **Explanation of `useScreenRecording` Hook**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, of all before we start understanding the code, we need to understand how does the `MediaDevices` works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[MediaDevices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) API**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MediaDevices` interface provides access to connected media input devices like cameras and microphones, as well as screen sharing capabilities. It is part of the WebRTC API and is commonly used for capturing audio and video streams in web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "`getDisplayMedia({video: true, audio: true})` : When this method is called, it prompts the user to select a screen or window to share. The user can choose to share their entire screen, a specific application window, or a browser tab. If the user grants permission, the method returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `MediaStream` object representing the selected display media.\n",
    "\n",
    "`getAudioTracks()` : This method returns an array of `MediaStreamTrack` objects representing the audio tracks in the `MediaStream`. If the stream contains audio tracks, you can access them using this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })` : This method prompts the user for permission to use a media input device, such as a microphone or camera. If the user grants permission, it returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `MediaStream` object containing the requested media tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user denies permission then the `Promise` will be rejected with a `NotAllowedError` `DOMException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mediaStream.getAudioTracks()` : This method returns an array of `MediaStreamTrack` object that represents `MediaStreamTrack` where `MediaStreamTrack.kind` is `\"audio\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can `for each` over the array and `enable` or `disable` the `MediaStreamTrack` by setting the `enabled` property to `true` or `false`. If `enabled` is set to `false`, the track will be muted, else it will be unmuted and the `track` is permitted to render audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mediaStream.addTrack(track)` : This method adds an object of type `MediaStreamTrack` to the `MediaStream`. The track can be either an audio or video track. Once added, the track becomes part of the stream and can be used for playback or transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Web_Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to do anything with the Web Audio API, we first need to create an [AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) object. This object is the main entry point to the Web Audio API and allows us to create audio nodes, connect them together, and control audio playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "`createMediaStreamSource(stream)` : This method creates a new `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` object that represents an audio source from a `MediaStream`. The `stream` parameter is the `MediaStream` object that contains the audio tracks you want to use as the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "`createMediaStreamDestination()` : This method creates a new `MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode` object that represents an audio destination for a `MediaStream`. This node can be used to route audio from the Web Audio API to a `MediaStream`, which can then be used for playback or transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "`createGain()` : This method creates a new `GainNode` object that represents a change in volume. The `GainNode` can be used to increase or decrease the volume of an audio signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`MediaRecorder` API**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MediaRecorder` API provides a way to record media streams, such as audio and video, in web applications. It allows you to capture media from various sources, such as the user's microphone or camera, and save it as a file or send it to a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes `MediaStream` as input and records the media data in chunks. The recorded data can be accessed through events like `dataavailable` and `stop`.\n",

    "### **Mixing Audio Tracks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Till now we need to understand that there are two types of audio that can be recorded:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Display Audio**: This is the audio that comes from the content being shared on the screen. It is captured from the `displayStream` and can include system sounds, video game audio, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Microphone Audio**: This is the audio captured from the user's microphone. It is obtained from the `micStream` and includes the user's voice and any other sounds picked up by the microphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, we've two types of audio, we need to mix them into a single audio track. Because if we've two separate audio tracks, it can lead to synchronization issues and make it difficult to manage the audio during playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that, we use the `Web Audio API` to create an `AudioContext`. We assign the current ref for the `audioContextRef` to a new instance of `AudioContext` i.e. `audioContextRef.current = new AudioContext();`\n",
    "\n",
    "`createAudioMixer` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "export const createAudioMixer = (\n",
    "  ctx: AudioContext, // AudioContext instance\n",
    "  displayStream: MediaStream, // MediaStream from getDisplayMedia which contains video track and optionally tab/display audio if allowed by user\n",
    "  micStream: MediaStream | null, // MediaStream from getUserMedia which contains microphone audio track if allowed by user\n",
    "  hasDisplayAudio: boolean // Boolean indicating if displayStream has audio track(s)\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we call the `createAudioMixer` function with the `audioContextRef`, `displayStream`, `micStream`, and `hasDisplayAudio` as parameters. This function creates an audio mixing graph using the Web Audio API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we pass the `audioContextRef`, `displayStream`, `micStream`, and `hasDisplayAudio` to the `createAudioMixer` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we check if both `hasDisplayAudio` and `micStream` are `null` or `false`, then we return `null` as there is no audio to mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we create a `MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode` using the `createMediaStreamDestination()` method of the `AudioContext`. This node will be used to route the mixed audio to a `MediaStream`. Anything connected to this node will be part of the output stream. We can access the final mixed single audio stream via the `.stream` property of this node i.e. `destination.stream` which is of type `MediaStream`. This final `.stream` is what we will add to our `combinedStream` later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we define a helper function `mix` that takes a `MediaStream` and a `gainValue` as parameters. This function creates a `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` from the provided stream, `gainValue` controls how loud that input is in the final mix. `createMediaStreamSource(stream)` creates a node that converts the media stream or audio track into `audio signal` that can be processed in `AudioContext`. The passed `stream` should have at least one audio track otherwise it will throw an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we create a `GainNode` using the `createGain()` method of the `AudioContext`. The `GainNode` allows us to control the volume of the audio signal. We set the gain value to the provided `gainValue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we connect the nodes i.e. `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode → GainNode → MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode`. By connecting multiple sources to the same destination, we effectively mix their audio signals together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then pass the `displayStream` to the `mix` function with a gain value of `0.7` if `hasDisplayAudio` is `true`. This means that in the final output audio, the display audio will be at 70% of its original volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we pass the `micStream` to the `mix` function with a gain value of `1.5` if `micStream` is not `null`. This means that in the final output audio, the microphone audio will be amplified to 150% of its original volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we return the `MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode`, which contains the mixed audio stream. This node can be used to access the final mixed audio stream via its `.stream` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Also,** as we've passed `DEFAULT_AUDIO_CONFIG` to `getDisplayMedia` which is `{ echoCancellation: true, noiseSuppression: true, sampleRate: 44100 }`, the `displayStream` will have `echoCancellation` and `noiseSuppression` applied to it if the browser supports these constraints. This helps improve audio quality by reducing echoes and background noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can add this mixed audio stream to our `combinedStream` by iterating over the audio tracks in `audioDestination.stream` and adding each track to `combinedStream` using the `addTrack` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, remember to `close` the `AudioContext` when we're done with the recording to free up system resources. We do this in the `useEffect` cleanup function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatively**, if we directly add the audio tracks from both the `displayStream` and `micStream` to the `combinedStream`, we won't have control over the individual audio levels, and both audio sources will be mixed at their original volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we'll get the `.stream` property of the `audioDestination` which is of type `MediaStream` and contains the mixed audio tracks. We iterate over the audio tracks in this stream and add each track to the `combinedStream` using the `addTrack` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we save the original streams (`displayStream` and `micStream`) in a custom property `_originalStreams` on the `combinedStream` because we've already mixed the audio tracks into a single track and if we need to stop the individual streams later, we can access them from this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we save the single `combinedStream` to the `streamRef` for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Till now , our `combinedStream` contains the `video track` from the `displayStream` and a single mixed `audio track` that combines audio from both the `displayStream` and `micStream`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, as `MediaStream` is like `signal` we need to enconde those `Video Frames` and `Audio Samples` and `muxes` them into a single container format like `webm` or `mp4` so that they can be stored and played back later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that, we create a `MediaRecorder` instance using the `setupRecording` function, passing the `combinedStream` and event handlers for `dataavailable` and `stop` events.\n",
    "\n",
    "So therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "**`setupRecording(stream: MediaStream, handlers: { onDataAvailable: (event: BlobEvent) => void; onStop: () => void; })` function**\n",
    "\n",
    "At first we pass `combinedStream` and `{ onDataAvailable, onStop }` to the `setupRecording` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`onDataAvailable` accepts an event of type `BlobEvent` and if the `event.data.size` is greater than `0`, it pushes the `event.data` (which is a `Blob` containing a chunk of recorded media data) to the `chunksRef.current` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "`onStop` is a callback function that is called when the recording stops. It invokes the `handleRecordingStop` function to process the recorded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, inside the `setupRecording` function, we create a new instance of `MediaRecorder` using the provided `stream` and `DEFAULT_RECORDING_CONFIG`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "export const DEFAULT_RECORDING_CONFIG = {\n",
    "  mimeType: \"video/webm;codecs=vp9,opus\", // Specifies the MIME type and codecs for the recorded media\n",
    "  audioBitsPerSecond: 128000, // Sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps\n",
    "  videoBitsPerSecond: 2500000, // Sets the video bitrate to 2.5 Mbps\n",
