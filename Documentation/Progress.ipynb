    "### **What is ORM?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`ORM` stands for `Object-Relational Mapping`. It is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. In simpler terms, it allows developers to interact with a database using the programming language's native objects, rather than writing raw SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Drizzle ORM**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an `ORM` for `TypeScript` that provides a simple and intuitive API for working with databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is `ORM` specifically for `serverless` databases i.e. `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `SQLite`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Installation of Drizzle ORM**\n",
    "\n",
    "To install `Drizzle ORM`, you can use `npm` or `yarn`. Run one of the following commands in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install drizzle-orm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll need to install `Drizzle Kit` that will create the `SQL` migrations. It is a command line tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install -D drizzle-kit // For Development\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will need `Postgres` package to talk to the `PostgreSQL` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install pg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll create `db.ts` file inside `drizzle/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file, we will write the Config to connect `Drizzle` and `Xata`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "import { drizzle } from \"drizzle-orm/xata-http\";\n",
    "import { getXataClient } from \"../xata\";\n",
    "\n",
    "export const db = drizzle(getXataClient()); // Export the DB connection\n",

    "- Used by **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used by **Better Auth** to understand your table structure\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You write** schema.ts with your desired table structure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **You run** `npx drizzle-kit push` to create/update tables in Xata\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **You run** `xata pull main` to sync the client with actual database\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Your app uses both:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `schema.ts` for `ORM operations` and `Better Auth`\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `xata.ts` for `HTTP` communication with `Xata`\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What Happens If You Delete schema.ts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Bad Effects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Better Auth breaks** - it needs your schema to know table structure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No type safety** in your Drizzle queries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Can't make schema changes** - no way to define new tables/columns\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No migrations** - can't evolve your database structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What Happens If You Delete xata.ts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Bad Effects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Xata HTTP client breaks** - can't communicate with database\n",

    "- **xata.ts** = The actual building that exists 🏗️\n",
    "\n",
    "You need the blueprint to make changes, and you need to know what the actual building looks like to use it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Best Practice - Keep Both and Understand Their Roles:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modify schema.ts** when you want to change your database structure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run `npx drizzle-kit push`** to apply changes to Xata\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run `xata pull main`** to sync the client\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`Bunny` is a video hosting and streaming platform that allows users to upload, store, and share videos. It provides a simple API for developers to integrate video functionality into their applications, making it easy to manage video content.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a `CDN` i.e. Content Delivery Network, which means it distributes video content across multiple servers worldwide to ensure fast and reliable delivery to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "It let's us `host`, `stream`, and `deliver` video content with low latency and high performance. `Bunny` also provides features like adaptive bitrate streaming, video analytics, and secure token authentication to enhance the video delivery experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Bunny Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `Bunny` free for 14 days. Login to [Bunny](https://bunny.net/) and create an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "First click on `Storage` then create a `Storage-Zone`. Choose `Geo Replication Zone`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, create a folder `thumbnail`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to `FTP & API Access` copy the `password` and paste in the `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, copy the `hostname` and paste in the `constants/index.ts` `STORAGE_BASE_URL='https://hostname/username'`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Now,\n",
    "\n",
    "After we've stored our `Files` we need to create something called `Pull Zones`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pull Zones` will be used to get our `Thumbnail` URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a Pull Zone, go to `CDN` then `Create Pull Zones` tab in your Bunny dashboard and click on `Add Pull Zone`. Give your Pull Zone a name i.e. `snapcat-pull-z` and select the `Storage Zone` you created earlier i.e. `snapcast-videos`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your Pull Zone is created, you will be given a `Pull Zone URL`. This URL is what you will use to access your video content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then copy the `Hostname` and paste it in the `constants/index.ts` file as `CDN_URL='https://snapcast-pull-z.b-cdn.net'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "After we store the videos, we will also need to stream those videos. For that we need to create got to `Stream` then create `Video Library` i.e. `stream-snapcast`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then click on `API`, copy the `Video Library ID` and paste it the `.env`. Similarly copy the `API Key` and paste it in the `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, copy the `CDN Hostname` and paste in the `constants/index.ts` file as `TRANSCRIPT_URL: \"https://vz-e62b6266-4f0.b-cdn.net\"`. This will be used for transcription. It is optional we can `enable` it by clicking on `Transcribing`.\n",

    "\n",
    "When a user clicks the **\"Sign in with Google\"** button on the `/sign-in` page, the request flows through several layers before completing authentication. Below is the hierarchical breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Frontend (React/Next.js page)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The button triggers a **POST request** to the backend endpoint `/api/auth/sign-in/social`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The request may include information such as the OAuth provider (Google) and optionally the user's email.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "fetch(\"/api/auth/sign-in/social\", {\n",
    "  method: \"POST\",\n",
    "  body: JSON.stringify({ provider: \"google\" }),\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Middleware Layer (`middleware.ts`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is the **first line of defense**, applied globally before the request reaches the route.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ArcJet rules applied here:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. `shield` → Blocks suspicious/malicious activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. `detectBot` → Allows only whitelisted bots (e.g., Google crawler) and blocks others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If a rule is violated → request is blocked immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If the request passes → it continues to the route handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. API Route Handler (`app/(auth)/api/[...all]/route.ts`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This layer handles **route-specific authentication logic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Parses the request body (JSON) safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Applies ArcJet rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - `emailValidation` → Blocks disposable, invalid, or no MX record emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - `rateLimit` → Limits requests based on user fingerprint or IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. If a request violates these rules → throws an error or blocks the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. If allowed → passes the request to the **Better Auth handler** i.e `return authHandler.POST(newReq);`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Better Auth Handler (`authHandler`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handles **OAuth workflow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Checks if the user is already authenticated.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. If not, redirects the user to **Google OAuth login page**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. User logs in with Google → Google returns an OAuth code/token to your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Better Auth exchanges the code for user info.\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. Creates a **session** in your backend and sets a **session cookie**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Browser Receives Session**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once authentication succeeds:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The session cookie is stored in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Frontend can now make authenticated requests to protected routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - User is considered logged in.\n",
