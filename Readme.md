**Next.js** - A React framework for building server-rendered applications with ease.

**Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive and modern user interfaces.

**Better-Auth** - A simple and secure authentication library for Next.js applications.

**Xata** - A modern database for building scalable and performant applications.

**Drizzle ORM** - A TypeScript ORM for building type-safe and efficient database queries.

**Typescript** - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

**bunny.net** - A cloud platform for deploying and scaling web applications with ease.
